Online tutoring platform: Create a web-based platform that connects students with tutors specializing in math or physics. The platform could include features like virtual classrooms, interactive whiteboards, and scheduling/payment systems.

Scientific data visualization platform: Develop a web-based platform that allows scientists and researchers to upload, visualize, and analyze large datasets from physics or mathematical experiments. The platform could include interactive graphs, statistical analysis tools, and collaboration features.

Virtual physics laboratory: Create a web application that simulates a virtual physics laboratory, allowing users to conduct experiments and explore various physics concepts. It could include interactive simulations, data analysis tools, and educational resources.

So, it will be educational-research-visualization-help problem, that will give following oopprtunities:

- Online tutoring platform
- Calculators
- Simulations
- Data analysis 
- etc.
